calibrate-joystick - a tool to calibrate joysticks on Linux systems.


Summary
=======

This is a graphical program to quickly calibrate range and deadzones
of joysticks.


Usage
=====

- Run the program.
- On the application window, select the desired input device.
- Move the sticks to their maximum range. This will be detected as the
  new minimum and maximum ranges.
- If needed, manually adjust the "Flat" paramter; that is the dead
  zone.
- Click "apply."
- Customization of joysticks is not permanent; it's lost when the
  device is unplugged, or when the system reboots.


Dependencies
============

This program requires a C++17 compiler. Additionally, it uses the
following libraries:

- gtkmm-3.0
- libevdev
- libgudev
- libevdevxx
- libgudevxx


Build instructions
==================

If building from the tarball, execute these commands:

    ./configure
    make
    sudo make install

If building from a cloned repository, you need to run the "bootstrap"
script once, before proceeding with the tarball steps.

This software uses Automake, so the standard Automake build options
apply. Check the "INSTALL" file and the "./configure --help" command
for more details.

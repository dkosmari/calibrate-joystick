Basics:
=======

"POTFILES.in" contains a list of files that are scanned for
translation.

The ".pot" file is the template file with the original messages. It's
generated automatically from the files listed in "POTFILES.in".

The ".po" files contain the translations. They're text files, and can
be edited with any text editor; a specialized translations editor like
"poedit" is recommended.

The ".po" files must be compiled to a binary format, as ".mo"
files. GNU Gettext sometimes uses the ".gmo" extension instead. The
binary files must be installed for the program to locate them, not the
".po" text files.



Updating translations:
======================

Inside the "po" directory, run:

  make update-po

This will update the ".pot" file, merge any changes with all ".po"
files, then compile them all. If the a compiled translation is not
present, it will not be installed.



Adding new translations:
========================

Edit the "LINGUAS" file to add the new language. See the gettext
manual for a list of language codes.

Then run the command:

  msginit -l CODE

where CODE is the language code you added. This will create an empty
"CODE.po" translation file.



Testing translations:
=====================

Gettext translation files must be organized inside specific
directories. Therefore, you need to install the program before the
translations can be used.

To avoid doing a system install every time you need to test the
translation, it's useful to configure a "local install" like this:

  ./configure --prefix=$PWD/test-install

Then "make install" will install into "test-install". When the program
is run, it will correctly load the translation files as specified in
the "LANGUAGE" environment variable:

  LANGUAGE=fr test-install/bin/calibrate-joystick
